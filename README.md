Nozbe has a very useful booklmarklet tool hidden away in the old Nozbe settings.

This Nozbe bookmarklet available in these settings is configured (hard coded) just for the account your logged into, you can drag it to your bookmarks bar and when pressed you get to create a new Nozbe task that stores the current webpage address you are currently on as a comment. Very handy when you come across a web page that triggers the idea of a task or project youâ€™d like to do.

##Introducing my Nozbe Chrome extension

I use Google Chrome as my browser of choice and I always hide my bookmarks bar as it gives me a few more pixels of screen to view websites;

Result = The Nozbe bookmarklet is hidden.

So to solve my own problem I created this small Chrome extension that gives you a button on your Chrome tool bar that when pressed launches the existing bookmarklet code. I then added an options page to manually enter your own API key so anyone can use it. Thats the kinda guy I am!

There were a number of requests to release this for others to possibly enhance in the future using the Nozbe API itself rather then rely on the aging Nozbe Script this extension calls.
